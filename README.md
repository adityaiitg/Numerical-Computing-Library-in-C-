## Numerical-Computing-Library-in-C++.
Building a library in C++ which can be used by anybody in numerical computing
using C++.
	
## Operation Supported.
The Library includes:
* Complex Numbers.
* Matrix operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiply
(Matrix-Vector and matrix-matrix multiply both), transpose, determinant,
inverse, etc.
* Matrix solutions using Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-
Seidel (under relaxation and over relaxation both), Gauss Elimination and
Conjugate Gradient
* function evaluations using algorithms like Newton-Raphson,
Forward Euler.
	
## Setup
To run this project, download and include the library.

## UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF Dr. Gaurav Trivedi, EEE Department, IIT Guwahati.
